# Tavern Crit (the all-in-one pub for DnD game coordination)
  
	This would be an application for tracking information about DnD games, ideally, it would have 2 modes, 1 for the Dungeon Master (DM) and 1 for the players. There would be several features that it has including connecting all the players in 1 game with their DM, allowing them to view their character sheets and other relevant info.
  
	On the DM side, there would be a tab to add notes about the campaign (and choose which to share as a recap for the players), a tab to create encounters and keep tabs on the monster statistics, a tab for homebrew (DM-created) items, etc.
  
	On the player side, there would be the character sheets, inventory tracking, spell tracking, etc. in a more mobile-friendly/web-friendly interface. The app would also probably have a dice roller that sends the DM the result of the dice rolls and who they came from to allow for online play when difficulties arise with using real dice and the DM does not want the players to cheat.

	There would have to be a database for all the items in the game and all the possibilities and would probably be improved by accessing DnD Beyond (a website that already exists with the databases and all) and then use this app as an extension to that for specific campaigns (whereas that app is good for sharing individual information, but not much with team coordination.
	
	I think the app would be a good amount of work to complete in its entirety, but since it is a very build-on type of app rather than a huge block of content, it would also really fit the agile method, and even if it isnâ€™t fully done, it could still be sufficient enough for use.
